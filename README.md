# Linear and Logistic Regression Notebook

After going through a couple of Deep Learning books and explanations, I noticed that I had some gaps in my understanding of Linear and Logistic Regression. I decided to write up this notebook as a way to help myself and other understand and visualize the concepts of the most basic (must most important in my opinion as well!) concepts of statistical learning.

If you find any errata (and there likely are some), do raise issues! I'll look at all of them.
